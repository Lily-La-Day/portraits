# The Selfie Project 


Not really a code thing, just a little page displaying some of the 365 daily self-portraits I did over the course of one year (back when I was art-y rather than code-y). Originally created as part of my first ever attempt at making a website (see, https://github.com/Lily-La-Day/lily-la-day-before)

https://lily-la-day.github.io/portraits/.
